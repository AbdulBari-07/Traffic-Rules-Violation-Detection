Open Anaconda Prompt.
Go to project directory.
Activate Virtual Platform.
Run "python Project-GUI.py".
Wait for the convolutional weights to be loaded. It will take some time.
The GUI opens.
Select any video file from your pc.
A preview will be loaded.
Now select Region of Interest.
Detection will start automatically.
This will be a slow process.
You can press "q" to exit.
Let's go to the directory.
Output video and detected vehicles are saved.

You can also open it from Anaconda Navigator.
Select Virtual Platform.
Launch Spyder.
Select the project directory.
Run "python Project-GUI.py".
Wait for the convolutional weights to be loaded.
The process is same as before.

Thank you for watching. The whole process was a bit slow for the low configuration of my pc.
Hope you will understand.
